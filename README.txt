This is a script that presents information on Star Wars characters by consuming the Star Wars API. It was created as a first experimentation with APIs and in creating scripts that take command line arguments. Responses are also cached for better perfomance.

It takes the following arguments:
a) search which is followed by a string with the character's name and the optional argument --world which presents additional information about the character's world of origin.
b) cache which is followed by the optional argument --clean which clears the cache.

Coded with Python 3.8, see requirements.txt for the dependencies.
